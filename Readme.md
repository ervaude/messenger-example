It also contains a custom webhook message.

The extension goes alongside two blog posts at [usetypo3.com](https://usetypo3.com):

* [Message Bus and Message Queue in TYPO3](https://usetypo3.com/messages-in-typo3/)
* [Outgoing Webhooks in TYPO3](https://usetypo3.com/webhooks-in-typo3/)


## Requirements
* TYPO3 12 LTS
